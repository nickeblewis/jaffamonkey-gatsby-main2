### WHAT I DO

* Test engineering that improves quality in the build/deployment pipeline, tracing requirements to code.
* Utilising custom opensource test frameworks tools as the foundation, for building automated tests.
* Automated accessibility, security, cross-browser and performance tests to run with every build.
