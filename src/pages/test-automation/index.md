_An often rushed consideration, the ideal is when it's runs parallel to development._

### Test Engineering

Test engineering is often a rushed consideration, when the ideal is when it part of the build and deployment pipeline.

Developers rightly do unit test, to test their code in an isolated way, but there are many layers to an application, and different issues can arise that can be be caught with UI or API tests.

With a maintained acceptance testing framework, you have effective environment to maintain effective automated testing, and prevent failing deployments (commonly down to basic issues).

I can bring effective test engineering to a project, with a "no waste" philosophy, which means a consistently useful testing framework. More importantly it should grow in parallel with the application it is designed to test.

Don't underestimate the effort required to do good test engineering, and don't underestimate how useful it can be.
